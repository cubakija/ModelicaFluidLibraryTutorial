Excellent tutorials (Google) translated from Japanese.

All credit goes to the authors: Amane Tanaka, Shu Tanaka (Amane Ryuken Co., Ltd.) and Open CAE Symposium, 11th Modelica Study library Meeting

I do not know the word of Japanese, but I mange to get meaningful English text  using available online tools.
My intention was also to keep original slide style. Apoligize in advance for small inconsistanceies and omitions.
