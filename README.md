All credit goes to the authors: Amane Tanaka, Shu Tanaka (Amane Ryuken Co., Ltd.), Open CAE Symposium,  11th Modelica Study library Meeting.

Folder with Modelica files has a few models builded, based on these tutorials. They work with OpenModelica.

I do not know the word of Japanese, but hope I get meaningful English translation using available online translators. 
My intention was to keep original slide style. 

Apoligize in advance for small inconsistanceies and omitions.
